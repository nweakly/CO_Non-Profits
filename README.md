# Colorado Non-Profits

This repository contains working versions of some of the files, including  EDA notebooks, data preprocessing, visualizations and Tableau dashboards,  for a collaborative project proposal  __Non-Profits Service Gaps__ aiming to uncover most urgent needs that could be alleviated by non-profit organizations working in Colorado. This project was created in collaboration with __msflebedorf__ ( https://github.com/msflebedorf) as part of the __Go Code Colorado__ competition (https://github.com/GoCodeColorado).  For the full description of the project, as well as presentation files, please see https://github.com/GoCodeColorado/NonProfitServiceGaps .
