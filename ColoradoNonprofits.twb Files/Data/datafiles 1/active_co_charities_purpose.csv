GIVINGVUE GARNERED APPROVAL AS A 501(C)(3) TAX-DEDUCTIBLE NONPROFIT BY THE IRS ON JUNE 26, 2014 (10 MONTHS AFTER SUBMITTING OUR APPLICATION).  GIVINGVUE'S FIRST PROJECT, LAUNCHED IN JULY 2014, CALLED FAITHVUE, WAS AN APP THAT PROVIDED A VISUALLY CAPTIVATING PERSONAL PRAYER PLACE TO BRING FOLKS CLOSER TO GOD BY WITNESSING AND SHARING GOD'S GRACES.  THE SMALL NUMBER OF USERS THAT INSTALLED FAITHVUE FOUND THE APP TO BE VERY ENGAGING AND FULFILLING.  UNFORTUNATELY, GARNERING DISTRIBUTION PARTNERSHIPS TO MARKET THE APP PROVED VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE DENOMINATIONS WANTED THEIR OWN PRAYER SPACE - BUT THAT WAS NOT OUR INTENT.  SO, IN 2015, GIVINGVUE TURNED ITS ATTENTION FROM FAITH FORMATION TO EDUCATION AND BEGAN PLANNING, PROTOTYPING, AND LAUNCHING ITS BEACON OF HONOR PROJECT ON NOVEMBER 11, 2015 (VETERANS DAY).  THIS TECH-DRIVEN, CIVIC-MINDED PROJECT UTILIZED NEW IBEACON HARDWARE FROM APPLE CONNECTED TO A 3RD PARTY APP - THE PLACEAPP.  FROM JANUARY 2016 TO MAY 2017, A SUCCESSFUL INCUBATION AND TEST OF THE BEACON OF HONOR PROJECT WAS COMPLETED AT THE ELEMENTARY AND HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL.  OUR 3RD PARTY IBEACON PARTNER, PLACE GLOBAL, THEN ROLLED OUT A NEW LOCATION-FINDING AND APP SOFTWARE UPGRADE IN THE FALL OF 2017 WHICH DELAYED OUR PILOT PROGRAM. THEN, AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS OF TESTING AND THEN TRYING TO ROLL IT, WE DETERMINED THE NEW SOFTWARE, APP CAPABILITIES, AND OVERALL USE OF IBEACON HARDWARE WAS NOT WORKING TO OUR SATISFACTION.  SO, IN MARCH OF 2018 WE RE-BRANDED AS 'FLAG STEWARD.' BUILT OUR OWN APP IN APRIL AND MAY. AND OFFICIALLY LAUNCHED ON FLAG DAY. TWO MONTHS, IT'S 10X BETTER.

IN SUPPORTING OTHER CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS WHO PROVIDE SKI SPORTS PROGRAMS, THE FOUNDATION CAN CONCENTRATE ITS EFFORTS ON FUND-RAISING TO MEET ITS GOALS WITHOUT THE CONSTRAINTS OF OPERATIONAL ISSUES, CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS OR THE LIABILITY ISSUES THAT ARE INHERENT TO THE SKI INDUSTRY.  RATHER THAN USING A LARGE POTION OF THE MONEY RAISED TO COVER OPERATIONAL EXPENSES AND SETTING ASIDE MONEY FOR POSSIBLE LITIGATION COSTS, THE FOUNDATION HAS CHOSEN TO CONTRIBUTE FUNDS TO OTHER SKI ORGANIZATIONS WHO ALREADY PAY FOR SUCH EXPENSES, THEREFORE ALLOWING THE FUNDS TO BE CONCENTRATED ONLY ON SKI PROGRAMS, LEAVING THE LIABILITY ON THE SKI ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDING THE TRAINING.  SINCE THE FOUNDATION'S ORGANIZATION, MEMBERS OF THE FOUNDATION HAVE MET WITH POTENTIAL CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS TO DISCUSS TRAINING AND RACING PROGRAMS AND FUNDING FOR SUCH PROGRAMS.

IT IS THE FOUNDATIONS' BELIEF THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THE PROGRAMS WILL COME FROM COMMUNITY LEADERS IN VAIL VALLEY REGION AND FROM INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE INVOLVED IN SNOW SPORTS, SUCH AS PARENTS OF SKI RACERS.  SINCE THE CONTRIBUTIONS WILL GO DIRECTLY TO CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS INVOLVED IN THE SKI INDUSTRY, THE FOUNDATION BELIEVES CONTRIBUTORS WILL CONTRIBUTE MORE READILY DUE TO THE CAREFUL CONTROL.

OUR GOAL IS TO OFFER UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION ON THE PROGRESS OF THE MEDICAL INDUSTRY, HOLISTIC, ALTERNATIVE AND WESTERN, AND MAKING THAT INFORMATION READILY AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE.   AFTER OUR SON MARC WAS DIAGNOSED IN 2007 WITH A DIFFUSE INTRINSIC PONTINE GLIOMA (DIPG) WE REALIZED HOW LITTLE HELP THERE WAS IN THE FORM OF TREATMENT, INFORMATION AND SUPPORT FOR THE FAMILIES FACING THIS TYPE OF CANCER.  MUCH OF THE INFORMATION WE DID FIND, FROM RESEARCH ONLINE OR MEDICAL JOURNALS, WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO DECIPHER BECAUSE IT WAS NOT IN LAYMEN TERMS.  HOWEVER, WE DID FIND THAT THERE ARE MANY FAMILIES WHO ARE FACING THIS PROBLEM OR HAD FACED IT AND THEY ARE WILLING AND WANTING TO HELP IN ANYWAY THEY CAN.  THROUGH THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT RESEARCH, THESE FAMILIES FOUND DIETS AND ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS THAT OFFERED THEIR CHILD A QUALITY OF LIFE THAT THE MEDICAL PROVIDERS DID NOT OFFER.  WE WANT TO WORK WITH FAMILIES WHO ARE STILL SEARCHING AND WITH FAMILIES WHO HAVE FOUND ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO HELP THEIR CHILD FIGHT THIS INSIDIOUS DISEASE.  WE MUST WORK AS A TEAM AND, IN DOING SO, I BELIEVE WE WILL COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT WE ARE THE ONLY HOPE OUR CHILDREN HAVE.   2008 WILL BE OUR FIRST YEAR AND OUR GOAL IS TO FORM A COMMITTEE OF DEDICATED LOCAL PEOPLE TO AWARD ANNUAL GRANTS WHICH WILL BE FUNDED BY LOCAL VOLUNTEER-ORGANIZED EVENTS, SUCH AS THE MJ'S WALK/RUN.

841405753	2018-02-01	"HISTORICALLY, T&R FUND'S PRIMARY FOCUS WAS THE EXECUTION OF THE T&R FUND FLYING SOLO SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM AT THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO AT COLORADO SPRINGS AND PIKES PEAK COMMUNITY COLLEGE.  THE PROGRAM WAS SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTED FOR 9 YEARS.  FOR THE 2017/18 SCHOOL YEAR WE GRANTED FORTY-SEVEN $5,000 SCHOLARSHIPS TO SINGLE PARENTS IN SEVERE FINANCIAL NEED.  WE BELIEVE OUR INVESTMENT IN EACH SCHOLARSHIP RECIPIENT GAINS POWER THROUGH ""LEVERAGE.""  BY INCREASING A SINGLE PARENT'S SKILL SET AND ATTAINED LEVEL OF EDUCATION, WE IMPROVE THE ODDS THAT THE PARENT'S CHILDREN WILL ASPIRE TO THE SAME OR HIGHER GOALS.  THE MAJORITY OF OUR SCHOLARS ARE THE FIRST TO ATTEND COLLEGE IN THEIR FAMILY.  THEY ARE ALL LIVING NEAR OR BELOW THE POVERTY LINE.    UNFORTUNATELY, IN 2017 THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO AND ITS RELATED FOUNDATION CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT GRANTING SCHOLARSHIPS TO SINGLE PARENTS MIGHT BE DISCRIMINATORY UNDER FEDERAL LAW AND THAT WE WOULD NEED TO EXPAND OUR PROGRAM TO COVER ALL CLASSES OF CAREGIVERS.  T&R FOUND THIS TYPE OF THINKING ABSURD ON MULTIPLE LEVELS.  AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE UNIVERSITY S DECISION, IN LATE 2017, WE PROVIDED $159,000 IN FUNDING TO THE UNIVERSITY VIA ITS FOUNDATION TO COVER OUR SHARE OF FUTURE SCHOLARSHIP COSTS FOR STUDENTS CURRENTLY IN THE FLYING SOLO SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM AND TERMINATED THE PROGRAM.  GOING FORWARD, T&R HAS NO INTENT OF FURTHER SUPPORTING THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO IN ANY MANNER.

THERE IS LITTLE IN THE WAY OF COLORADO AEROSPACE HISTORY AVAILABLE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC, EITHER IN PRINT, ONLINE, OR IN PUBLIC DISPLAYS.

COLORADO MUSEUMS, ESPECIALLY IN SMALLER COMMUNITIES, OFTEN FIND IT DIFFICULT TO PRODUCE HIGH-QUALITY EXHIBITS, DUE TO BUDGET CONSTRAINTS AND HIGH STAFF WORKLOADS. FEEDBACK FROM SEVERAL COLORADO MUSEUMS INDICATES THAT AN AFFORDABLE TRAVELING EXHIBIT ON COLORADO AEROSPACE HISTORY WOULD BE POPULAR WITH THEIR VISITORS. THE TEST SCORES OF AMERICAN STUDENTS IN MATH AND SCIENCE LAG BEHIND THOSE OF MOST OF THE DEVELOPED WORLD. THE AVERAGE ADULT'S UNDERSTANDING OF SCIENCE IS OFTEN INADEQUATE FOR THE COMPLEX, SCIENCE-BASED DECISIONS FACING OUR SOCIETY, FROM ENERGY USE AND STEM CELL RESEARCH TO BIODIVERSITY AND GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE. YOUNG PEOPLE ARE OFTEN APATHETIC OR INTIMIDATED BY SCIENCE AND FAIL TO DEVELOP STRONG CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS. THEY NEED INSPIRATION AND ENCOURAGEMENT TO DEVELOP THEIR INTEREST, AND AEROSPACE HISTORY PROVIDES EXCITING REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES AND ROLE MODELS. WHILE A HISTORY EXHIBITION DOES NOT NECESSARILY ADDRESS MATH OR SCIENCE CONTENT DIRECTLY, THE STORIES OF ADVENTURE AND CHALLENGE CAN FOSTER CURIOSITY AND RAISE AWARENESS, PROVIDING MOTIVATION TO LEARN AND SUCCEED."
